// A BST also called binary search tree is a binary tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties âˆ’
// The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key.
// The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.
// In this program, we will create a BST and perform the following operations on it:
// 1. Insert a node
// 2. Delete a node
// 3. Search for a node
// 4. Inorder Traversal
// 5. Preorder Traversal
// 6. Postorder Traversal
// 7. Find the minimum and maximum element in the tree
// 8. Find the height of the tree
// 9. Find the kth smallest and kth largest element in the tree
// 10. Find the LCA of two nodes in the tree
// 11. Find the level of a given node in the tree
// 12. Find the number of leaf nodes in the tree
// 13. Find the number of full nodes in the tree
// 14. Find the number of half nodes in the tree
